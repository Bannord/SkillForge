This project is a compilation of various fun features. On the first tab, you can explore GitHub users and utilize a search function. If desired, you can open a user's profile and follow the link to their GitHub page to view their activities. On the banking page, you can create a currency card, deposit money onto it, and make withdrawals.

The current stack implemented in the project includes the following:

React hooks: These are functional components that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
React-Redux: This library integrates React with Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
React-router-dom: This package provides routing capabilities to navigate between different pages or views in a React application.
Redux-thunk: This middleware enables the use of asynchronous actions in Redux, allowing you to dispatch functions instead of plain objects.
Together, these technologies create a robust and efficient framework for building the project.
